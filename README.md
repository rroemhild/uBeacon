# uBeacon

MicroPython library for encoding and decoding AltBeacon, Eddystone-UID, Eddystone-URL and iBeacon. This library does not handle the advertise or scan part, because of the different MicroPython forks handle bluetooth different ways.

This library is in an early stage, expect things to change until there is a release.
